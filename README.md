Some of Platelet's goals are:

- Provide a robust service for recording assignment details, synchronized across all devices

- Let volunteers coordinate cross country relays over a wide network of groups

- Focus on ease of use and a smooth user experience

- Provide more detailed tracking information for deliveries

- Allow direct requests for deliveries by external users

- Provide reports and statistics

It can be deployed to AWS using Amplify or can be used fully offline with no online synchronization.
